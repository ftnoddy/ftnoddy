👀 I'm interested in web development, blockchain, and related technologies.

🌱 Currently, I'm learning more about smart contract development and decentralized finance (DeFi) on blockchain platforms.

💞️ I'm interested in collaborating on projects that involve building decentralized web applications, creating smart contracts, and developing blockchain-based solutions for businesses or startups.
